Please take a look at my code~
Data!!!!!!!! Science!!!!!!!
Game Behavior Data Collection SDK (GameEventTracker Class) This part implements the in-game event tracking system. The main functions include:
Initialize player sessions and user information Track various game events (startup, payment, upgrade, task completion, card drawing, etc.) Ensure data security through a signature mechanism Send data to the backend server for analysis

This SDK is designed to be embedded in the game client to collect player behavior data and provide a basic data source for subsequent analysis. 2. Player Churn Warning Model (ChurnPredictionModel Class) This is a machine learning model used to predict the risk of player churn:

Prepare multi-dimensional feature data, including activity, game progress, social behavior, and consumption habits Use the random forest algorithm to train the churn prediction model Evaluate model performance and analyze feature importance Predict the probability of churn for each player and classify it as low/medium/high risk Support model saving and loading

This model helps the operation team identify players who may churn in advance and implement targeted retention measures. 3. Real-time data processing Flink task (process_game_events function) This part processes real-time game data streams, and its functions include:

Use Apache Flink framework to process event streams in Kafka Set up a checkpoint mechanism to ensure fault tolerance Validate, transform and enrich raw event data Filter invalid events to ensure data quality Send processed data to downstream systems

This module implements the basic work of real-time data analysis and supports real-time monitoring and rapid response. 4. Data visualization Dashboard (Dash application) This is an interactive data analysis platform that mainly displays:

Key business indicator (KPI) panel: DAU, revenue, new users, retention rate, etc. Trend chart: daily active user changes, revenue trends User retention heat map: display user retention in different periods Player level distribution and payment conversion funnel chart Support filtering data by game and time range

The platform provides decision makers with intuitive data visualization and supports data-driven decision making.
